The code is a full-stack web application that manages contacts. It is written in JavaScript and uses the following technologies:

    MongoDB (a NoSQL database) and Mongoose (a MongoDB Object Modeling library for Node.js) for storing the contacts information.
    Express (a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js) for handling HTTP requests and responses.

The code consists of 3 files:

    Contact.js:
    This file exports a Mongoose model named "Contact" with a specified schema. The schema defines the structure of the documents in the "Contact" collection. The fields defined in the schema are:
        fullName: A string field that is required and its value must be a non-empty string.
        username: A string field that is required, unique, has a minimum length of 3 characters and a maximum length of 20 characters.
        phrase: A string field that can have any value.
        avatar: A string field that represents an URL. The URL must start with "http" and it has a default value.

    controller.js:
    This file exports an object named "contactController" with methods for managing the contacts:
        index(): Returns all the contacts in the "Contact" collection.
        showById(id): Returns a contact with the specified id. If the id is invalid, it returns a rejected promise with an error message "Invalid ID".
        showByUsername(username): Returns the first contact with the specified username.
        create(contact): Creates a new contact in the "Contact" collection.
        updateById(id2Update, updatedContact): Updates a contact with the specified id. If the id is invalid or the updated contact has an "id" or "_id" field, it returns a rejected promise with an error message.
        updateByUsername(username, updatedContact): Updates the first contact with the specified username.
        deleteById(id2Delete): Deletes the contact with the specified id. If the id is invalid, it returns a rejected promise with an error message "Invalid ID".
        deleteByUsername(username): Deletes the first contact with the specified username.

    index.js:
    This file exports an Express router with two endpoints:
        "/api/contacts": Handles HTTP GET requests to "/api/contacts". It returns all the contacts in the "Contact" collection.
        "/api/contact": Handles HTTP GET requests to "/api/contact". It returns a contact with the specified id or username. If both are specified, it returns a contact with the specified id. If neither is specified, it returns a rejected promise with an error message.

In summary, the code ties in together by defining the structure of the contacts in the "Contact" collection and providing methods for managing the contacts in the "contactController" object. The Express router handles the HTTP requests and responses and uses the "contactController" methods to interact with the database.
